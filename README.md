# CS35L-Project: UCLA Geoguesser

## Project Goals: 
Our project is designed to implement a UCLA GeoGuesser. <br>
Basically, our app will allow UCLA students to guess different locations around campus and upload photos to the database. <br>
There will be a log in prompt where users can authenticate and save there scores and rankings.<br>
We plan to have a leaderboard that tracks people's scores so people can try to beat each other in Geoguesser.<br>
Another feature we are considering is adding a rating for difficulty after guessing a photo. <br>
We also will allow users to insert queries to search for different photos in the database.<br>
This is a general summary of what the project will contain.
