# CS35L-Project: UCLA Geoguesser

## Project Goals: 
Our project is designed to implement a UCLA GeoGuesser. Basically, our app will allow UCLA students to guess different locations around campus and upload photos to the database. There will be a log in prompt where users can authenticate and save there scores and rankings. We plan to have a leaderboard that tracks people's scores so people can try to beat each other in Geoguesser. Another feature we are considering is adding a rating for difficult after guessing a photo. We also will allow users to insert queries to search for different photos in the database. This is a general summary of what the project will contain.
